## Description
As developers, we have a responsibility to protect the data our users trust us with. No one wants to wake up to the news that their site was hacked and all of the user accounts stolen.

Security is important, yet it is often overlooked and forgotten.

Part of the reason for this is that security seems hard to get right. This results in developers crossing their fingers and hoping for the best.

One of the best ways to protect your applications from attack is to first understand how attacks are carried out.

Workshop Topics Include:
- Session hijacking (and how to prevent it)
- Securely configuring cookies and protecting the data inside them.
- Using Charles proxy to simulate a man-in-the-middle attack.
- Set up HTTPS & HSTS in a development environment to mitigate MITM attacks.
- Exploit and Mitigate CSRF with CSRF tokens
- Exploit and Mitigate XSS with CSP.
- Security rules of thumb such as "defense in depth" and "principle of least power".
