Asciicasts for [Kent C. Dodds](https://egghead.io/instructors/kentcdodds)'s course, The Beginner's Guide to React on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io//courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react)

## Description
React got that name for a reason. It’s a component-based JavaScript library that renders smartly and can seriously simplify your work.

This course is for React newbies and anyone looking to build a solid foundation. It’s designed to teach you everything you need to start building web applications in React right away.

Each lesson in this 19-part course is a single `index.html` file. This keeps your focus on learning React, no distractions. We’ll start with a blank file and add more complexity as we go along, wrapping the course with a lesson on how to move into a more production-ready development environment—and even deploy your app to a great service like Netlify.

You'll come out of this course with a solid grasp on:

- what problems React can solve
- how React solves those problems under the hood
- what JSX is and how it translates to regular JavaScript function calls and objects

You’ll build a solid understanding so when you come across JavaScript challenges down the road, you’ll know how to…react.
